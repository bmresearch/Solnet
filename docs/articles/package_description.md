# Package description

Solnet is composed of several libraries, each containing their own specific functionalities. This means that you don't need to import all the assemblies if you're just looking for very specific functionality.

## Solnet.Rpc

The assembly Solnet.Rpc contains all the RPC API abstractions needed to communicate with the Solana nodes, be it using HTTP or WebSockets. 
This assembly contains all the models needed for such calls.
This assembly only depends on the Solnet.Wallet due to the Transactions API, which needs to be able to sign transactions.

The Solnet.Rpc assembly contains the base Transaction builder that can be used to implement your own specific programs.

## Solnet.Wallet

The assembly Solnet.Wallet contains the constructs needed to initialize wallets that conform to Bip32 or Bip39 standards. 
These constructs, when used appropriately, are compatible with the keys generated using the `solana-keygen` CLI tool and the keys generated on [Sollet.io](https://sollet.io).
As mentioned above, this library also contains the needed tools to sign data from a given account.

Solnet.Wallet has [Chaos.NaCl](https://github.com/p3root/Chaos.NaCl/) and [BouncyCastle](https://github.com/novotnyllc/bc-csharp) as the sole dependencies.

## Solnet.KeyStore

The assembly Solnet.KeyStore contains constructs and utilitiy methods necessary to save and restore wallets as well as encrypt and decrypt keystores.
It includes an implementation of the [Web3 Secret Storage Definition](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Web3-Secret-Storage-Definition) which generates a JSON file with an encrypted keystore, with only the correct password being necessary to decrypt it. It also includes a simpler keystore implementation that is capable of restoring keys generated by the `solana-keygen` CLI tool.

The KeyStore depends on the Solnet.Wallet project assembly, plus [Chaos.NaCl](https://github.com/p3root/Chaos.NaCl/) and [BouncyCastle](https://github.com/novotnyllc/bc-csharp).

## Solnet.Programs

The Solnet.Programs assembly implements and abstracts the usage of several Solana programs. These programs are either the [Native Programs](https://docs.solana.com/developing/runtime-facilities/programs) or part of the [SPL](https://spl.solana.com/).
If you're looking for more specific implementations, than you may have to look at [Solnet.Serum](https://github.com/bmresearch/Solnet.Serum), Solnet.Pyth, Solnet.Mango or even start your own using our APIs.
